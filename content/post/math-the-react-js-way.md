Have you found yourself doing intense math problems using weird symbols like `+`,
`âˆ’`, `Ã·`, and `Ã—`? Do you enjoy the speed and developer experience of React.js? Thanks
to *react-real-math* you can now harness the power of the React.js Virtual DOM to
make your Math blazingðŸ”¥ fast!<!--more-->

*react-real-math* provides an incredibly easy to understand API out of the box,
for free. What a deal! Letâ€™s take a look at an example of *react-real-math* in
action. Consider this old-school almost obfuscated math problem:

```
1+1Ã—2=?
```

Incredibly hard to parse. But with *react-real-math* this is a breeze to understand:

```
import { computeValue, Multiple, One, Two } from 'react-real-math'
console.log(computeValue(
  <Multiply by={<Two/>}>
    <One/>
  </Multiply>
))
```

Now thatâ€™s what I call ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ family. Blazing fast, amazing DX, and great DSL. Not
only is this incredibly easy to read, new developers can easily understand
whatâ€™s going on here. If you would like to contribute to *react-real-math* please
